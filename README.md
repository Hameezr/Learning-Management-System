# Learning-Management-System

Develop an information system to record information about students, courses, registrations, attendance and marks. The system holds data for multiple semesters.
Each course has multiple sections. Students can add/drop a course only during the registration period. Similarly the students cannot withdraw a course after the deadline.
A teacher may teach multiple sections of different courses. She can record attendance of her students, and can enter marks and grades. She can set the evaluation criteria, including the number and type of evaluations along with weights.
A student can view her transcript containing information about all the semesters of her degree. The transcript describes information about the student, courses, grades, SGPA and CGPA.
If a section is full and a student is interested to register, she can subscribe and the system shall notify her when any seat becomes available.
A user can perform a transaction only if she has the required privilege. Besides the students and the teachers, there are academic officers who enter information about basic entities such as courses, sections, students and teachers. Also these officers open and close registration, and set a deadline for withdrawal.
